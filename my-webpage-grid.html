                    It's high time we as Africans invested in our own continet, touring could be one of many ways of
                    doing that. We could get to go around, invest in our own continent, know it and know our brothers
                    and sisters as well and their different types of culture as well. Africa is such an amazing and unique
                    Continent which needs to be explored, and Bulawayo City it might be what you need to see, it
                    has the great Victoria Falls, the biggest waterfall in the world. it is between Zimbabwe and Zambia.
                    it makes this roaring sound when water hits the ground,the people call it the smoke that thunders,
                    it's such an amazing place to be at. Bulawayo has many touring sides one could visit. I like the fact
                    that Ndebele people recided in that side of Zimbabwe, I as a South African I would relate a lot with
                    them
                    mainly because of culture and where they originally came from before they migrated to Zimbabwe and
                    places they have been before settling down there in that side of the Country they got such a rich
                    history, it's beautiful
